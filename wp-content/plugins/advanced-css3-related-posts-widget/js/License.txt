Release changelog

    v1.3 (released June 25th, 2009):
    - Fixed "recurring divs in content" bug. If your tab contents included div tags, the tabs would break due to a faulty div tag count. Thanks to Sebastian L?scher (www.ddfriends.de) for providing the very simple fix!
    - Separated all CSS classes at the top of the script, in case you need to modify them to suit your HTML/CSS structure.
    v1.2: Fixed stupid IE syntax error which caused the script to break in IE browsers.
    v1.1: Namespaced the entire script
